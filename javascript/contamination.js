// An AI has infected a text with a character!!

// This text is now fully mutated to this character.

// Starting with the original text, and given a character, return the text once it has been mutated so that all of the characters in the original text have been replaced with the character.

// If the text or the character are empty, return an empty string.

// My Solution:

function contamination(text, char){
  return char.repeat(text.length)
}
