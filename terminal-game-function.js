// In this game, the hero moves from left to right. The player rolls the dice and moves the number of spaces indicated by the dice two times.

// Create a function for the terminal game that takes the current position of the hero and the roll (1-6) and return the new position.

// My Solution:

const move = (solution, roll) => solution + roll * 2
